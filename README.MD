# About
A simple project to use and ABUSE puppeteer in a non-headless environment.

" I solemnly swear that I am up to no good." - H.P.

Basically, this project is made for people like myself who have ADD and want to try and get organized and more focused. The problem I had was my bookmarks on chrome were well over 1mb and that was just unmanagable so I needed a way to better compartmentalize and make everything more managable.


# WARNING
Puppeteer is not intented to be used like this. It's supposed to be a "headless browser". But personally I really like automating stuff, even minor things like pulling up a browser and going to a web site(s). 

Also even if you use chrome, there is a good chance that you may run into websites that think you are a bot crawling their site instead of a lazy developer. Consider using a vpn when using this if your local laws are dumb.

If you are equally as lazy, ADD, etc considering trying this out and helping to improve the bookmarks, and dev enviroment.



# Install:
1. Install node / npm
2. Be awesome

# Start up
Run `npm i` and then run `npm start` to start up a isoloated web broswer and pick the desired bookmarks.


# Find info on your Browser
On the normal browser you use go to, `chrome://version/` .

Here you can easily find the Executable Path and Profile Path (userDataDir setting).


# Possible Future Related Projects
1. Chrome Canary Version for testing new css / js specs like houdini (already in progress).
2. Firefox Version
3. Edge Chromium Version (to automatically download chrome because we're "jerks" and want MS to get out of the browser game forever).
